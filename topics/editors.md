# Editors

If you are comfortable with a code editor already, it's probably fine. Try to avoid Dreamweaver and other [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), for this class at least. Recommendations:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [Textmate](http://macromates.com/)
